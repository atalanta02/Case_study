# Historical development 
## Timeline of key events 
** Before 1940**
After recognizing larger numbers but still used digits from 0 to 9. Businessmen from China, Turkey and Greece used the abacus (abacus) to perform the calculations.  In 1617, John Napier came up with logarithmic calculations and invented a tool called the Napier bone. Blaise Pascal invented the first mechanical calculation machine in 1642.  This machine operates by moving the gears on the wheels. 
The beginning of the actual computer was formed by an English professor of mathematics, Charles Babbage (1791-1871). 


In 1812, Babbage noticed how machines were excellent at solving recuring mathematical problems. Babbage's first machine was called the Differential Machine in 1822 proposed for calculating differential equations. After working with the Differential Machine for ten years, Babbage was suddenly inspired to start building the first general-purpose computer, called the Analytical Engine. Babbage's assistant, Augusta Ada King (1815-1842), the first female programmer helped revise plans, seek funding from the UK government, and communicate the Analytical Engine's specifications to the public.







  
In 1903, John V. Atanasoff and Clifford Berry attempted to create an electric computer that applied Boolean algebra to electrical circuits. This approach is based on the work of George Boole (1815-1864) in the form of the binary algebraic system, which states that any mathematical equation can be declared as true or false. Howard Aiken introduced the use of an electromechanical machine called the Mark I in 1937. By applying true-false conditions into electrical circuits in a disconnected form, Atanasoff and Berry created the first electric computer in 1940. However, their project was halted due to a lack of funding sources.
**ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) **
The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer), designed and built by John Mauchly and John Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania was the world's first general-purpose electronic digital computer. The ENIAC was completed in 1946 since the proposal was submitted in 1943, so that 1946 was the gateway to a new era of electronic computers. The ENIAC was created under the Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory (BRL). It had more profound contributions to advance in the military science and technology. ENIAC simulated explosions of atomic and hydrogen bombs, airflow at supersonic speed during the cold war. It is known as the origin point of programming, as it had its first six operators were hired in mid-1945. 
The ENIAC was used by (Ballistics Research Laboratory) BRL for war purposes until 1955. After that, the ENIAC is no longer used. This generation of computers has begun to store data known as the stored program concept proposed by John Von Neuman.

# VIEWPOINTS 
## Business Viewpoint analysis 
### Defining the Business viewpoint
From a business perspective, the evolution of computing machines isn’t just about faster processors, smaller circuits, the internet, artificial intelligence, automation and much more. It’s about how those advancements transformed industries and economies, improved efficiencies and changed the way businesses operate.

### The Transformation Through Business Eyes
The evolution of computing machines through business eyes reveals a significant shift from specialised, expensive tools to indispensable, commodity driven  systems that essentially reshaped organisational operations and market dynamics.

•   1940s and 1950s: Originally, computing was dominated by mainframe systems used mostly by large businesses and governments, with hardware development being at the forefront and software being considered a secondary, often free, component bundled with hardware.

•   1970s: This then began to shift when the arrival of microprocessors, integrated circuits that placed an entire processing unit on a single chip, completely reformed computers from costly, complex machinery into small, affordable and more accessible devices. Around 1975, the computer’s role in business went through a transformation from a mere calculation engine to a digital communications platform, enabling new forms of organisational architecture and strategic alignment.

•   1990s: Additions to computing that shaped how businesses of that time used computers would have to be the rise of Local Area Networks(LANs) and the internet. Businesses began connecting PCs to share files, printers, and data, leading to the concept of “group computing”. Email and early groupware significantly reduced paperwork and meeting time, boosting collaboration and promoting efficiency.

### Economic Impact
Not only have computers sped up things, but they have also changed the economy significantly. They drove productivity, cut costs, and pushed industries to rethink how they worked.

Despite the “productivity paradox” in the  1980s and 1990s, where big companies were pouring money into IT but broad economic numbers were unchanged. However when you zoom in, the picture changes. In sectors that employ heavy computerisation, productivity of labour registered an annual increase of 5.7% from 1990 to 1996, compared to 2.8% before. The sectors that didn’t rely on computers didn’t keep up.

The sector responsible for producing computer hardware and software, also has some great numbers. It accounted for about 33% of U.S. total factor productivity growth in the 1980s. Innovation was crazy, and computing power was falling in price by more 17% a year from the mid-70s to the mid-90s. During that time businesses found it a lot easier to invest funds in technology instead of hiring people in response to a notable sharp decline.

The computer dense part of the economy, the services are trickier. Many productivity gains are not clearly visible in the official statistics, meaning the actual impact may actually be greater than what is actually recorded. On top of that, computing changed the structure of the labour market and raised the demand for skilled workers that have university degrees, notably in finance and in legal services where the use of computers exploded.

Today, AI and cognitive automation are extending this trend. If AI can raise the productivity in cognitive work by around 30%(which currently makes up around 60% of the value added), the productivity might end up rising by around 18%.
The economic worth of computing is far greater than simply cheaper operations or faster tasks. It involves embracing new ideas and reimaging work to transform industries from within.

### Market Competition and Business Strategy
By 2000, the most successful firms came to be “computerless computer companies”. These firms used cheap, powerful hardware to deliver applications and services, not build machines. An example is Microsoft, which used dominating operating systems and productivity software. IBM went from hardware to enterprise services and integration.

Creative destruction reshaped completion in Schumpeterian waves. Companies like IBM and Microsoft succeeded in new product markets like PCs and browsers. However, these incumbents later encountered diseconomies of scope. This was due to organisational conflict in sharing assets across established business and newer venture. This often caused innovative units to be squashed by legacy divisions.

The winning strategies highlighted the importance of anticipating technological changes, building trust based relationships with customers, and exploiting learn serve loops, which involves using technology to improve our offering. Companies such as Amazon, Apple and Google have eventually asserted leadership through integration of hardware, software, cloud services to create sticky ecosystems.

Today, business competition revolves around AI, cloud infrastructure, and data networks. The largest tech firms, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet dominate market value not from their products in isolation, but rather from the platforms that at least lock in users and developers, turning computing into strategic, scalable, and deeply profitable engine.

### Connection to Module Concepts
Looking at the evolution of computing machines through a business lens, we are directly linked to several concepts of the module that lays emphasis on the impact of technology on forms of enterprise, competition, and a set amount of economic value.


### Societal Viewpoint Analysis
Now from a societal viewpoint, the evolution of computing machines is more than just a technical timeline,  the evolution of computing machines has been a story about how people, communities and even cultures have been reshaped by new ways of how we communicate, learn and work that have been introduced. As computers have long moved past from originally being niche machinery in labs to everyday tools present in homes, schools, and workplaces, society had to adapt at every age.

### The Transformation Through Society Eyes
Computing has completely changed how we communicate as a society, making it not only instantly  but also globally. The internet and email broke down previous distance barriers, allowing instant communication with anyone in the world. Social media platforms have enabled people to create virtual communities based not on location but on shared interest also which has helped creating relationships and mobilising socially. Access to information has become easier, however it has introduced challenges like misinformation and digital echo chambers.

•	1645-1694: The first forms of computing machines were the mechanical calculators designed  by Blaise Pascal in 1645 and Gottfried Leibniz in 1694 to solve navigational and scientific problems. These two scientists began the development of computing machine Europe Entered a new and greater period of scientific development and international trade.

•	Twentieth Century: The first electronic computers were developed for military purposes due to world war 2. The computers that are being used today are the descendants of the early efforts which were mainly used for military planning and calculating. Society’s needs and desires have led to the development of a wide range of computing technologies, including supercomputers, graphics, processors, games, digital video, mobile computing devices and telephones.

•	Twenty-first century – In the twenty first century computers are being employed in various fields of society like, agriculture, art, commerce and global trade, communication, education, governance, law, music, politics, science, transportation, and writing.

### Economic Impact
Computing Machines have changed the economy in a way that has impacted society tremendously. It has given productivity gains, globalisation, etc. at the same time when labour markets became polarised. The wage gap between college educated workers has grown, and computer machines have been a key factor.  There increasing demand for labour that is able to work with computers. Most sectors are now tech intensive which increases demand for labour that is able to work with computers.

The impact of automation on many routine middle skill jobs has done away with many clerical, manufacturing and administrative middle skill jobs. However, it has also given birth to high skill jobs in tech and the data field. This job polarisation is blamed for rising wage inequality, which is accruing to the highly educated. Earlier adopters of computer use, women and white collar professionals are reported to have benefitted in terms of relative wage.

E-commerce giants and platform companies like Amazon and Alibaba were able to upend conventional retail and banking thanks to digital economy. Despite their controversy, cryptocurrencies and blockchain represent a change in the way that trust and value are handled. In the meantime, traditional labour laws and social contracts are being challenged by gig economy, which is driven by digital platforms and has redefined employment.

### Connection To Module Concepts
From a societal perspective, the development of computing devices directly relates to a number of fundamental ideas we discussed in the module regarding how technology affects individuals, groups, and social structures.

# Ethical reflection and improvements 
Introduction to Ethical Challenges 

The evolution of computing devices, although a remarkable feat of engineering and a massive cause of international trade, poses a range of significant ethical dilemmas

Digital Divide 

Global internet usage continues to expand, given the increase in the number of computers owned and internet access. A divide persists between the information rich and information poor, which are people with lower incomes, education levels, skill and capacity, as well as those living in rural areas. The global computing society is experiencing some fundamental ethical problems, its complexity and global dimensions are rapidly evolving. The Internet has become a prerequisite for living in modern society, having become essential to the functioning of the economy. However, the exponential growth of computing and the transformation that this has created in all aspects of everyday life has resulted in the emergence of a broad spectrum of problems culminating into social exclusion and digital inequality. The people are facing a growing number of uncertainties related to the use of the digital environment such as the digital security threats and incidents that have increased the financial, privacy, and reputational consequences, and in some cases, produce physical damages. Although stakeholders are increasingly aware of these challenges raised by digital security risk, they often approach the problem only from the technical perspective, and in a manner that tends to play down on the ethical implications of the social cleavages in digital utilization and applications. People have tried to articulate a more nuanced conceptualization of the digital divide as a series of social gaps. The digital divide is not about computers or connectivity but rather, the divide is the social gaps between humans that have and use ICTs, and societies that lack access to ICTs tools as well as skills to operate them. The failure to have fair social access amounts to living on the wrong side of the digital divide and poses serious social challenges. However, the exigency of the digital divide is not about denying its existence, but to ensure that the focus on the digital divide does not adapt to social exclusion and inequality.
