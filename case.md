# Introduction 
This case study examines one of the most important transformations in computing: The evolution of computing machines including the first steps taken by Charles Babbage in the nineteenth century, through ENIAC first electronic computers during the wartime to PCs which led to laptops and smartphones that we now use. 
We will look at the transformation through two viewpoints: business and . We will then we will see discuss the ethical implications of the transformation with regards to the,  
 
This development is important, because it shows the development of computers and how they have impacted the world in terms of the business side and
# Historical development 
## Timeline of key events 
** Before 1940**
After recognizing larger numbers but still used digits from 0 to 9. Businessmen from China, Turkey and Greece used the abacus (abacus) to perform the calculations.  In 1617, John Napier came up with logarithmic calculations and invented a tool called the Napier bone. Blaise Pascal invented the first mechanical calculation machine in 1642.  This machine operates by moving the gears on the wheels. 
The beginning of the actual computer was formed by an English professor of mathematics, Charles Babbage (1791-1871). 


In 1812, Babbage noticed how machines were excellent at solving recuring mathematical problems. Babbage's first machine was called the Differential Machine in 1822 proposed for calculating differential equations. After working with the Differential Machine for ten years, Babbage was suddenly inspired to start building the first general-purpose computer, called the Analytical Engine. Babbage's assistant, Augusta Ada King (1815-1842), the first female programmer helped revise plans, seek funding from the UK government, and communicate the Analytical Engine's specifications to the public.







  
In 1903, John V. Atanasoff and Clifford Berry attempted to create an electric computer that applied Boolean algebra to electrical circuits. This approach is based on the work of George Boole (1815-1864) in the form of the binary algebraic system, which states that any mathematical equation can be declared as true or false. Howard Aiken introduced the use of an electromechanical machine called the Mark I in 1937. By applying true-false conditions into electrical circuits in a disconnected form, Atanasoff and Berry created the first electric computer in 1940. However, their project was halted due to a lack of funding sources.
**ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) **
The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer), designed and built by John Mauchly and John Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania was the world's first general-purpose electronic digital computer. The ENIAC was completed in 1946 since the proposal was submitted in 1943, so that 1946 was the gateway to a new era of electronic computers. The ENIAC was created under the Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory (BRL). It had more profound contributions to advance in the military science and technology. ENIAC simulated explosions of atomic and hydrogen bombs, airflow at supersonic speed during the cold war. It is known as the origin point of programming, as it had its first six operators were hired in mid-1945. 
The ENIAC was used by (Ballistics Research Laboratory) BRL for war purposes until 1955. After that, the ENIAC is no longer used. This generation of computers has begun to store data known as the stored program concept proposed by John Von Neuman.

# VIEWPOINTS 
## Business Viewpoint analysis 
### Defining the Business viewpoint
From a business perspective, the evolution of computing machines isn’t just about faster processors, smaller circuits, the internet, artificial intelligence, automation and much more. It’s about how those advancements transformed industries and economies, improved efficiencies and changed the way businesses operate.
### The Transformation Through Business Eyes
The evolution of computing machines through business eyes reveals a significant shift from specialised, expensive tools to indispensable, commodity driven  systems that essentially reshaped organisational operations and market dynamics.
•   1940s and 1950s: Originally, computing was dominated by mainframe systems used mostly by large businesses and governments, with hardware development being at the forefront and software being considered a secondary, often free, component bundled with hardware.
•   1970s: This then began to shift when the arrival of microprocessors, integrated circuits that placed an entire processing unit on a single chip, completely reformed computers from costly, complex machinery into small, affordable and more accessible devices. Around 1975, the computer’s role in business went through a transformation from a mere calculation engine to a digital communications platform, enabling new forms of organisational architecture and strategic alignment.
•   1990s: Additions to computing that shaped how businesses of that time used computers would have to be the rise of Local Area Networks(LANs) and the internet. Businesses began connecting PCs to share files, printers, and data, leading to the concept of “group computing”. Email and early groupware significantly reduced paperwork and meeting time, boosting collaboration and promoting efficiency.
